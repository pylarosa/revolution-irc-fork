# Revolution IRC – A Modern Fork

This is a fork of [Revolution IRC Client](https://github.com/MCMrARM/revolution-irc) by [MCMrARM](https://github.com/MCMrARM), with the goal of modernizing the codebase and deepening my understanding of real-world software development.

## About This Project

I'm using this fork as a learning opportunity to work with Java, Kotlin, Android development, and IRC protocol specifications. My contributions are limited by my day job, but I'm committed to gradually improving and expanding the codebase.

This is an active learning project—feedback, collaboration, and insights are always welcome.

## Vision and Values

Eventually, once the codebase has been sufficiently modernized and I've gained deeper expertise, I plan to transition this into an independent IRC client release.

Privacy and security are core values for this project. As the codebase matures, I plan to implement robust privacy protections and security best practices as foundational features of the final release, within the constraints of the IRC protocol itself.

## Contributing

I'm open to suggestions, pull requests, and technical discussions. Whether you're also learning or have expertise to share, I'd appreciate the input.
